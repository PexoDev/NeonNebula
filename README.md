This is my very first fully finished game I've ever done. It's been made in Unity3D engine. I'm sharing all source code of it with all of you. You can feel free to use and learn from it. 

The code surely isn't cleanest and most optimized piece of programming art, although it's, as far as me and my "QA" are concerned, free of any bugs.

I decided not to share anything but the C# code, to make the game run you'll need to make unity project, make scenes, add objects on them and then attach scripts. If you are not very familiar with Unity this won't allow you to simply clone repo and make game by your own, if you however know the engine and just doesn't feel like coding, with some thinking you should be able to make it run without bigger isuess.

I am not planning to write any documentation or anything such as this for the code that's in this repository, although if someone is struggling with any parts of it you can feel free to ask me questions via email: contact[at]pexogamedev.pl.
